I recently started using the [Impact Engine](http://impactjs.com/) for some hobby game development. I spent Sunday working with a JavaScript port of the awesome Box2D physics engine making some fun little demos.  Here is a link to a simple [‘Pong Inspired’ demo]({{ site.url }}/box2dpong/).  It’s nothing special, but it was an education in JavaScript, Box2D and Impact getting it all to work.

Enjoy!
