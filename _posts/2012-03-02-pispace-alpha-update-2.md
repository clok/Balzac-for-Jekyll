It’s been a busy week and lots of fun work has been completed on [PiSpace]({{ site.url }}/pispace). I have updated the version online and released the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/clok/PiSpace! Please feel free to fork the code and tweak what you like. The published code includes assets and code entities. The Impact Engine is a licensed engine, so if you have a license then just place the code in the standard impact root directory. Also, I am on [PointOfImpact](http://www.pointofimpactjs.com/games/view/34/pispace) which is a great source for the Impact Engine.

The new features for v0.2:

* Title Screen
* 3 game play modes
* 2 Player mode
* AI War! mode
* Much improved AI
* Refined physics handling
* mute/unmute music
* Some under the hood changes include better commenting, more efficient XForm updates & some sound tweaks.

Upcoming features:

* Particle effects
* Pause menu
* EndGame
* More AI tweaks
* Better page integration
* “Tunneling” graphical effects
* Mobile controls & compatibility
* and more…

Enjoy!
