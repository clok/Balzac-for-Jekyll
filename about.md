My name is [Derek Smith](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dereksm/en).  I geek out over numbers, data, code, games, sports & physics.

Early on I found I had a fascination with analyzing, describing and modeling systems.  I thank my parents for supplying me with an endless supply of Legos growing up which fostered this fascination into something tangible.  I tend to view complex systems (code, nuclear reactors, PDEs) as well designed Lego sets, each individual piece serving a critical role that when combined with the other pieces forms a detailed model.  Because of this I have a knack for focusing in on one small piece of a system while still considering the effect of that component on the system as a whole.  This is why I find Physics, Math and Code so enjoyable.

Since graduating with a B.S. in Physics & Minor in Mathematics at The California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, a.k.a. CalPoly SLO, in 2008 I have spent my time employed as a Software Engineer working on large real-time data processing systems.  I specialize in performance analysis, especially at the hardware/software interface.  The nature of real-time data processing across multiple SI’s and physical machines makes understanding, characterizing, tuning and optimizing IPC and internal software latencies essential.  I have developed many analysis tools to assist me in modeling these aspects and wish to bring the lessons I have learned to others.

The goal of this blog is to discuss the findings, lessons and curiosities I have run into through my technical work. I have experience in Perl, Python, PHP, Unix, Linux and many other things.  If you are interested in my CV please contact me at `derek(at)clokwork.net` or on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dereksm/en).  You can follow me on GitHub ([@clok](https://github.com/clok)) and on Twitter ([@cloksmith](https://twitter.com/cloksmith))!

I hope you enjoy!

Cheers –

Derek
